<h1>THE PEACEMAKER</h1>

<h2>By Alfred Coppel</h2>

<p class="hd1">Illustrated by BOB MARTIN</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">We humans</span> are a strange
breed, unique in the Universe.
Of all the races met among
the stars, only <i>homo sapiens</i> thrives
on deliberate self-delusion. Perhaps
this is the secret of our greatness,
for we are great. In power, if not
in supernal wisdom.</p>

<p>Legends, I think, are our
strength. If one day a man stands
on the rim of the Galaxy and looks
out across the gulfs toward the
seetee suns of Andromeda, it will
be legends that drove him there.</p>

<p>They are odd things, these
legends, peopled with unreal creatures,
magnificent heroes and despicable
villains. We stand for no
nonsense where our mythology is
concerned. A man becoming part
of our folklore becomes a fey, one-dimensional,
shadow-image of reality.</p>

<p>Jaq Merril&mdash;the Jaq Merril of
the history books&mdash;is such an image.
History, folklore's jade, has
daubed Merril with the rouge of
myth, and it does not become him.</p>

<p>The Peacemaker, the chronicles
have named him, and that at least,
is accurate in point of fact. But it
was not through choice that he became
the Peacemaker; and when
his Peace descended over the
worlds of space, Merril, the man,
was finished. This I know, for I
rode with him&mdash;his lieutenant in a
dozen and more bloody fights that
earned him his ironically pacific
laurels.</p>

<hr />

<p>Not many now living will remember
the Wall Decade. History,
ever pliable, is rewritten often, and
facts are forgotten. When it was
gone, the Wall Decade was remembered
with shame and so was expunged
from the record of time.
But I remember it well. It was an
era compounded of stupidity and
grandeur, of brilliant discovery and
grimy political maneuver. We, the
greedy men of space&mdash;and that includes
Jaq Merril&mdash;saw it end with
sorrow in our hearts, knowing that
we had killed it.</p>

<p>If you will think back to the
years immediately preceding the
Age of Space, you may remember
the Iron Curtain. Among the nations
of the Earth a great schism
had arisen, and a wall of ideas was
built between east and west. Hydrogen
bombs were stockpiled and
armies marched and countermarched
threateningly. Men lived
with fear and hatred and distrust.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, came the years
of spaceflight and the expanding
frontiers. Luna was passed. Mars
and Venus and the Jovian Moons
felt the tread of living beings for
the first time since the dawn of
time. The larger asteroids were
taken and even the cold moonlets
of Saturn and Uranus trembled
under the blast of Terran rockets.
But the Iron Curtain still existed.
It was extended out into the gulf
of space, an intangible wall of fear
and suspicion. Thus was born the
Wall Decade.</p>

<p>Jaq Merril was made for that
epoch. Ever in human history there
are those who profit from the stupidity
of their fellows. Jaq Merril
so profited. He dredged up the
riches of space and took them for
his own. And his weapon was man's
fear of his brothers.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It was</span> in Yakki, down-canal
from the Terran settlement at
Canalopolis, that Merril's plan was
born. His ship, the <i>Arrow</i>, stood on
the red sands of Syrtis Major, waiting
for a payload to the Outer System.
It stood among a good many
like it: the <i>Moonmaid</i>, the <i>Gay
Lady</i>, the <i>Argonaut</i>, and my own
vessel, the <i>Starhound</i>.</p>

<p>We, the captains, had gathered
in the Spaceman's Rest&mdash;a tinkling
gin-mill peopled with human
wrecks and hungry-eyed, dusty-skinned
women who had come out
to Mars hoping for riches and had
found only the same squalor they
had left behind. I remember the
look in Merril's eyes as he spoke
of the treasures of space that would
never be ours, of the gold and
sapphires, the rubies and unearthly
gems of fragile beauty and great
price. All the riches of the worlds
of space, passing through our hands
and into the vaults of the stay-at-homes
who owned our ships and
our very lives. It seemed to me that
Merril suffered as though from
physical pain as he spoke of riches.
He was nothing if not rapacious.
Greedy, venal, ruthless. All of that.</p>

<p>"Five of us," he said in a hard
voice, "Captains all&mdash;with ships
and men. We carry the riches of
the universe and let it slip through
our fingers. What greater fools
could there be?"</p>

<p>Oh, he was right enough. We
had the power to command in our
hands without the sense to grasp it
firmly and take what we chose.</p>

<p>"And mark you, my friends,"
Merril said, "A wall has been built
around Mars. A wall that weakens
rather than strengthens. A wonderful,
stupid, wall...." He laughed
and glanced around the table at
our faces, flushed with wine and
greed. "With all space full of
walls," he said softly, "Who could
unite against us?"</p>

<p>The question struck home. I
thought of the five ships standing
out there on the rusty desert across
the silted canal. Five tall ships&mdash;against
the stars. We felt no kinship
to those at home who clung to
creature comforts while we bucketed
among the stars risking our
lives and more. We, the spacemen,
had become a race apart from that
of the home planet. And Merril
saw this in our faces that night so
long ago, and he knew that he had
spoken our thoughts.</p>

<p>Thus was born the Compact.</p>

<p>Gods of space, but I must laugh
when I read what history has recorded
of the Compact.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Merril, filled with the wonder
of his great dream, spoke his mind
to the Captains. He told them of
the sorrow in his heart for his divided
fellow men, and his face grew
stern when he urged them to put
aside ideology and prejudice and
join with him in the Compact.</i>"</p></div>

<p>So speaks Quintus Bland, historian
of the Age of Space. I imagine
that I hear Merril's laughter
even as I write. Oh, we put aside
ideology and prejudice, all right!
That night in Yakki the five Captains
clasped hands over the formation
of the first and only compact of
space-piracy in history!</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It was</span> an all or nothing venture.
Our crews were told nothing,
but their pockets were emptied
and their pittances joined with
ours. We loaded the five ships with
supplies and thundered off into the
cobalt Martian sky to seek a stronghold.
We found one readily enough.
The chronicles do not record it accurately.
They say that the fleet of
the Compact based itself on Eros.
This is incorrect. We wanted no
Base that would bring us so close
to the home planet every year. The
asteroid we chose was nameless,
and remained so. We spoke of it
seldom aspace, but it was ever in
our minds. There was no space
wall, there to divide us one from
the other. It was a fortress against
the rest of mankind, and in it we
were brothers.</p>

<p>When we struck for the first time,
it was not at a Russian missile post
as the histories say. It was at the
<i>Queen of Heaven</i>, an undefended
and unsuspecting merchantman.
The records of Earth say the <i>Queen</i>
was lost in space between Uranus
and Mars, and this is so. But she
was listed lost only because no Russian
or American patrol found her
gutted hulk. I imagine that at this
very moment she hangs out beyond
Pluto, rounding the bend of the
long ellipse we sent her on that day
we stripped her bones.</p>

<p>She carried gold and precious
stones&mdash;and more important yet,
women being furloughed home
after forced labor in the mines of
Soviet Umbriel. The <i>Starhound</i>
and the <i>Arrow</i> bracketed her a million
miles above the plane of the
ecliptic near Saturn's orbit, and
killed her. We drew abreast of her
and forced her valves. We boarded
her and took what we chose. Then
we slaughtered her men and sent
them on their long voyage. That
was the beginning.</p>

<p>The attack against Corfu was our
next move. This is the battle that
Celia Witmar Day has described in
verse. Very bad verse.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"<i>Corfu slumbered, gorged and proud&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>While</i> Arrow, Hound <i>and</i> Maid <i>marshalled</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Freedom's might above the tyrant's ground,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And rained down death&mdash;</i>"<br /></span>
</div>

<p>There is much more, of course.
Brave phrases of emotion and fanciful
unreality written by one who
never saw the night of space agleam
with stars.</p>

<p>There was no talk of tyranny or
liberty aboard the <i>Hound</i> that day
we leveled with the <i>Maid</i> and the
<i>Arrow</i> a thousand miles over the
Russian Base of Corfu. There <i>was</i>
talk of the bullion stored under the
fortress' turrets.</p>

<p>Merril's face appeared in my
visor screen, superimposed on the
image of the grimy little asteroid
floating darkly against the starfields.</p>

<p>"Their radar has picked us up
by now, and they're wondering who
we are," he said, "Take the <i>Hound</i>
out on tangent left and join the
<i>Maid</i>. Cover my attack and stand
by to put a landing party aground."</p>

<p>I watched the image of the
<i>Arrow</i>&mdash;a sliver of darkness against
the crescent of Corfu&mdash;lancing
down at the fortress. Her forward
tubes were glowing with the familiar
pre-discharge emanation.</p>

<p>Below us, confusion reigned. For
the first time in memory an asteroid
Base was under attack. Merril
brought the <i>Arrow</i> in to within fifty
miles and then unleashed the fury
of his forward tubes. Hellfire coruscated
over the steel turrets and
stone walls of Corfu. It splashed
like a liquid flame over men and
metal and twisted the towers and
buttresses into spidery tendrils of
glowing thread. Corfu died without
firing a shot.</p>

<p>We put a party from the <i>Hound</i>
aground ten hours later. Even then,
we had to wear insulated suits to
walk in that still molten inferno.
Charred bodies had become one
with the stuff of the fortress, and
nothing living was left within the
keep. We looted Corfu's treasure
and lifted into space heavy with
gold.</p>

<hr />

<p>Time passed in an orgy of looting
for the men of the Compact.
We grew rich and arrogant, for in
space we were kings. Torn by suspicion
of one another, America and
Russia could do nothing against us.
They had built an Iron Curtain in
space, and it kept them divided
and weak.</p>

<p>Endymion felt our blasts, and
Clio. Then came Tethys, Rhea,
Iapetus. We cared nothing for the
flag these Bases flew. They were
the gathering points for all the gold
and treasure of space and we of the
Compact took what we wished of
it, leaving a trail of blood and
rapine behind us. No nation
claimed our loyalty; space was our
mother and lust our father.</p>

<p>Thus, the Peacemakers.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">For five</span> full years&mdash;the long
years of the Outer Belt&mdash;the
<i>Arrow</i>, the <i>Starhound</i>, the <i>Moonmaid</i>,
the <i>Lady</i> and the <i>Argonaut</i>
were the scourges of the spacelanes.
No patrol could find us, and no defense
could contain us. I recall how
we laughed at the angry sputtering
of Earth's radio. Vast sums were
spent in searches and new weapons
to protect the meek and the mutually
distrustful from Merril and
the men of the Compact. Budgets,
already strained to the breaking
point by generations of the cold
war, creaked and groaned as Russians
and Americans spent furiously
to build up their defenses against
our depredations. But though we
were few and they many&mdash;space
was large and it hid us well.</p>

<p>And then one darkling day, Jaq
Merril and I stood on the thin
methane snow that carpeted our
Base's landing ramp, waiting under
our own blue-black sky for the return
of the <i>Argonaut</i>. Merril had
sent her sunward to strike at the
mines of Loki, an asteroid where
Russian <i>komisars</i> rolled in mountains
of blood-red rubies.</p>

<p>We waited through the day and
into the sable night, but the <i>Argonaut</i>
did not return. For the first
time since the formation of the
Compact, we had lost a ship, and
something like unease crept into
our hearts. The carousal that night
had no gaiety, and there was the
sound of bereaved women weeping.</p>

<p>Merril could learn nothing of the
<i>Argonaut's</i> fate. It was as though
she had dropped through a hole in
the fabric of space itself and vanished
from the ken of men. To me
he said: "I fear a new weapon."
But to the rest, he kept his peace
and let the work of the Compact
continue. There was nothing else
to be done. Our Wall Decade was
waning, and when a man or a Compact
outlives the age that gave him
or it birth, there is nothing to do
but go forward and meet the new
day dawning.</p>

<p>So it was with the Compact. We
lived on as we had lived before:
looting and killing and draining the
wealth of space into our coffers. But
in the back of our minds a shadow
was lurking.</p>

<p>On the next raid, the <i>Lady</i> was
lost. I saw it happen, as did Merril.
There was nothing we could do to
help her, and she died, spilling men
into the void as she ruptured in her
last agony.</p>

<p>It was off Hyperion, whence we
had come to loot the trove built
there by the prospectors of the
Saturnian Moons. And it was a
trap.</p>

<p>The <i>Arrow</i>, the <i>Hound</i> and the
<i>Lady</i> circled the moonlet, swinging
inward to the attack. It was the
<i>Lady</i> who was to put aground the
raiding party, and her valves hung
open while men readied the assault-boats.
Our radar screens showed
nothing of danger. There was only
the bloated giant in the sky, a
ringed monster of yellow gold
against the starry velvet of space.</p>

<p>The <i>Lady</i> dropped her boats, the
<i>Hound</i> and the <i>Arrow</i> hovering by
to watch over their sister. And suddenly,
the jagged moonscape below
erupted&mdash;belching streaks of fire
that sought us like probing fingers.
I knew in one single instant of terror
that this was the new weapon
that had killed the <i>Argonaut</i>, for it
sliced into the <i>Lady's</i> flanks as
though the steelite hull were cheese.</p>

<p>She bulged, glowing like an ember.
There was a sudden nimbus of
snow about her as her air escaped
and froze, and then she rolled into
her death-dance, open from bow
to stern, spilling scorched corpses
into the void.</p>

<p>The <i>Arrow</i> and the <i>Hound</i>
drove off into space like furies leaving
the spinning body of their sister
ship behind, not waiting to watch
her crash down onto the rocky face
of Hyperion. And now the five of
the Compact were only three, and
again there was the sound of weeping
among our women.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Two months</span> after that engagement,
a single assault-boat
returned to Base. It was the lone
survivor of the <i>Lady's</i> landing
party. By some miracle, the three
men aboard had escaped the holocaust.
They had landed and been
captured and then they had fought
their way free and into the void
once more. They were half-dead
from starvation and exposure, but
they had brought word to Merril
that the wall that had so long protected
us was crumbling.</p>

<p>Merril sought me out, his lean
hard face grim and set.</p>

<p>"There was a Russian among the
Americans on Hyperion," he said.</p>

<p>"A prisoner?" It was my hope
that spoke so, not my sure knowledge
of what was to come.</p>

<p>Merril shook his head slowly. "A
technician. They developed the
beam that killed the <i>Argonaut</i> and
the <i>Lady</i>&mdash;together." His voice was
harsh and bleak. Then suddenly he
laughed. "We've touched them,"
he said, "Touched them on their
tender spot&mdash;their purses." He
bowed low, filled with bitter mockery.
"Behold the diplomats, the
men who are accomplishing the
impossible!"</p>

<p>And I knew that his words spelt
doom. Doom for the Compact and
for the Wall Decade that was our
life.</p>

<p>Yet we did not stint. In that year
we raided Dione, Io, Ganymede,
and even the American naval Base
on Callisto. We gutted six Russian
and four American rockets filled
with treasure. And we ventured
sunward as far as the moons of
Mars.</p>

<p>We dared battles with patrol
ships and won. We killed the destroyer
<i>Alexei Tolstoi</i> off Europa
and we shattered an American
monitor over Syrtis itself, and
watched the wreckage rain down
on Yakki, the place where the Compact
was born.</p>

<p>And we lost the <i>Moonmaid</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p>The radio told us the story.
Other new weapons were being developed
against us, and here and
there American and Russian spacecraft
were seen in company for the
first time in the history of the Age
of Space. Convoys were formed
from ships of both flags to protect
spatial commerce from the imagined
"great fleet" of the Compact.
None knew that only the <i>Arrow</i>
and the <i>Starhound</i>, small ships,
weary ships, were left to face the
slowly combining might of Earth.</p>

<p>And then at last, the pickings&mdash;growing
slimmer always&mdash;diminished
to the vanishing point. Merril
stood before us and gave the assembled
crews their option.</p>

<p>"The treasure hunt is over," our
captain told us, "And those who
wish may withdraw now. Take
your women and the space-boats
and return to Mars. You have your
shares, and you can live in comfort
wherever you may choose. If you
wish it, go now."</p>

<p>Some few did go, but most remained.
I watched Merril's face,
and saw one last plan maturing
there. Then he spoke again and we
all understood. One last raid ... to
take Luna and command the
world!</p>

<hr />

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Still the unity of Mankind was
not secure, and Merril, filled with
impatience for his great dream, decided
on one final stroke. He would
descend on Luna Base itself with
his fleet, and commanding all
Earth, he would drive men together&mdash;even
though it might
mean his own death. With this plan
of self-immolation in his heart, the
Peacemaker ordered his hosts and
sought the pumice soil of the mother
planet's moon....</i>"</p></div>

<p>This is the way Quintus Bland,
historian and scholar, puts it down
for posterity. I, one of "his hosts,"
would say it another way.</p>

<p>We had gutted the Solar System
of its treasure and at last men were
uniting against us. Our "fleet" was
reduced to two small ships and a
bare handful of men and women
to fight them. Jaq Merril could see
the handwriting on the wall and he
knew that all must be gambled on
one last throw of the dice. Only
with Terra herself under our guns
could we hope to continue sucking
the juice of the worlds into our
mouths. It was all or nothing, for
we had grown used to our life and
we could no longer change it to
meet the demands of the dawning
age of Soviet-American amity.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Side by side</span> the <i>Arrow</i> and
the <i>Hound</i> slanted sunward.
Mars behind us, ahead lay the
Earth-Moon system. Ten years had
passed since any of us aboard the
Compact ships had seen the home
world, and though we no longer felt
a part of it, the sight of the silvery
cloud-flecked globe touched our
hearts. Touched them as the
sapphires of Mimas or the gold of
Corfu touched them. We saw the
planet that gave us birth and we
were filled with hunger for it. To
own it, command it, make it our
own.</p>

<p>Luna's mountains were white
and stark under our keels as Merril
led us across the curve of the
southern horizon, seeking to put
us into position to attack the UN
Moon Base in Clavius from the
direction of the Moon's hidden
face.</p>

<p>We swung low across unnamed
mountain ranges and deep sheer
valleys steeped in shadow. The
voice of the ranger in the <i>Arrow</i>
came softly through the open intercom
into the tiny control room of
the <i>Hound</i>. A woman's voice, tense
with excitement, but disciplined
and controlled.</p>

<p>"Range five hundred miles, four
seventy five, four fifty&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then Merril's voice, calm
and reassuring, giving heart to all
the untried ones aboard with his
steady conning commands.</p>

<p>"Four o'clock jet, easy, hold her.
Drivers up one half standard.
Steady goes. Meet her. Steady&mdash;"</p>

<p>Line astern now, the two ships
flashing low across the jagged lunar
landscape, and a world in the balance&mdash;</p>

<p>An alarm bell ringing suddenly,
and my screen showing the fleeting
outline of a Russian monitor above,
running across our stern. My own
voice, sharp with command:</p>

<p>"Gun pointer!"</p>

<p>"Here, sir!"</p>

<p>"Get me that gunboat."</p>

<p>The <i>Hound's</i> turret wound about
with agonizing slowness as the
monitor reached for the sky, clawing
for altitude and safety. And
then there came a searing blast of
fire and the fragments of the Russian
gunboat raining down lazily,
seeking their eternal rest in the
pumice of Luna's hidden face.</p>

<p>But they had been warned at the
UN Base. The monitor had left one
dying shriek in the ether, and the
waiting garrison had heard. Merril
knew it, and so did I. We moved
forward calmly, into the jaws of
hell.</p>

<hr />

<p>The <i>Arrow</i> attacked from ten
o'clock, low on the horizon, the
<i>Hound</i> from twelve o'clock high.
We swept in over the batteries of
pulsating projectors, raining down
our bombs. The ground shuddered
and shook with the fury of exploding
uranium and the sky was laced
with a net of fiery death. The
<i>Hound</i> shrieked her protest as I
swung her about for another attack.</p>

<p>There was a sickening swerve and
the smell of ozone in my ship.
Somewhere, deep within her, a
woman screamed and I felt the
deck under me give as one of the
questing beams from the fortress
below cut into the hull. Airtight
doors slammed throughout the
wounded vessel, and I drove her to
the attack again, hard. The last of
the bombs clattered out of the
vents, sending mushrooms of pumice
miles into the black sky. One
battery of guns below fell silent.</p>

<p>The <i>Arrow</i> vanished into the
night above and as suddenly reappeared,
her forward tubes spewing
red fire onto the Base below. Then
Merril pulled her up again and disappeared
among the pale stars.</p>

<p>The <i>Hound's</i> hurt was mortal, I
could feel her dying under my
hands, and tears streaked my face.
Below decks, she was a shambles
where the cutting beam from the
ground had torn part of her heart
out. Still I fought her. There was no
retreat from this last raid, nor did
I wish any. There was a madness in
us&mdash;a blood-lust as hot and demanding
as ever our lust for gold
and treasure might have been.</p>

<p>I lashed the face of the fortress
with the <i>Hound's</i> forward tubes,
frantically, filled with a hateful anguish.
I felt my ship losing way,
twisting and seeking rest on the
jagged ground below, and thinking
he had deserted us, I cursed Merril
in an ecstasy of blind fury.</p>

<p>Again and again the <i>Hound</i> was
hit. I knew then that Merril's plan
had been madness, a last gesture of
defiance to the new age of unity
among men. The <i>Hound</i> fell at last,
spitting fire and gall in a futile
dance of death.</p>

<p>She struck on a high plateau,
grinding into the pumice, rolling
with macabre abandon across the
face of the high tableland. Then at
last she was still, hissing and groaning
fitfully as she died, her buccaneering
days gone forever.</p>

<p>I donned a suit and staggered,
half dazed, out into the lunar night.
A half-dozen men and women from
the crew had survived the impact
and they stood by the wreckage,
faces under the plastic helmets
turned skyward. They were one and
all stunned and bleeding from the
violence of the <i>Hound's</i> end, but
they looked neither back nor
around them. Their eyes were filled
with the insane glory of the drama
being enacted in the sky.</p>

<p>The <i>Arrow</i> had returned. She
lanced down out of the night like a
spear of flame, vengeful and deadly.
Straight into the mouth of the
screaming guns she dove, death
spilling from her tubes. She bathed
the Moon Base in fire, searing the
men within&mdash;Russian and American
alike&mdash;into the brotherhood of
death.</p>

<p>Miraculously, she pulled up out
of her encircling net of flame. We
watched in openmouthed wonder
as she reached with sobbing heart
for the sky just once again&mdash;and
then, failing, crippled and dying,
she hung above the crater's rim,
framed with deadly beams from
below, but radiant in her own right&mdash;gleaming
in the light of the sun.</p>

<p>This was defeat. We knew it as
we stood by the tangled pile of
steelite that had been the <i>Hound</i>
and watched the <i>Arrow</i> die. But
nothing in this life that I have lived
ever told me so grandly that the
Wall Decade was ended&mdash;and our
life of buccaneering with it&mdash;as the
thing that happened next.</p>

<p>The <i>Arrow's</i> valve opened and
a tiny figure stepped out&mdash;into
space. I did not need to be told that
Jaq Merril was coming to meet the
men he had welded together against
him.</p>

<p>Lazily, unreally, the tiny shape
twisted over and over as it fell, until
at last it vanished amid the raw
welter of craters and ridges beyond
the razor wall of Clavius....</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">I&nbsp;have told</span> a true tale,
though one that will not be believed.
I have taken the Peacemaker
of the histories and painted him <i>as
he was</i>.</p>

<p>But men are ashamed, and the
chronicles of history must be rewritten
to hide their weaknesses,
Jaq Merril has become a legend,
and the man that I knew is forgotten.</p>

<p>Merril&mdash;pirate, fighter, grandiose
dreamer. That was my captain. Not
the colorless do-good creature of
the legend. Merril fought for lust
and greed, and these are the things
that will one day take men to the
stars. He knew this truth, of course,
and that was the substance of his
great dream. Because of it, there
are no longer walls in space, and
the men who united to fight the
Peacemaker will one day rule the
universe.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, chroniclers will write
lies about him, and Jaq Merril's
laughter will echo in some ghostly
Valhalla beyond the farthest star.</p>

<p class="pa1">THE END</p>
